# Calling-and-Texting-using-arduino
In this project, Arduino and GSM module is used to call or to send text messages.

# GSM-module
A GSM Module is basically a GSM Modem  (like SIM 900) connected to a PCB with different types of output taken from the board â€“ say TTL Output (for Arduino, 8051 and other microcontrollers) and RS232 Output to interface directly with a PC (personal computer). The board will also have pins or provisions to attach mic and speaker, to take out +5V or other values of power and ground connections. These type of provisions vary with different modules.

For calling and texting messages a keypad is also attached and a LCD to make sure you are writing correct.
